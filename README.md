# PortfolioProjects
Hi, I'm Said! I'm currently pursuing a Master’s degree in Applied Economics and Markets at the University of Bologna, where I’m building a strong foundation in quantitative analysis, data interpretation, and economic modeling.

I’m passionate about using data to understand complex systems and support decision-making. During my academic journey, I've worked with tools like Python, R, SQL, Excel, and Power BI to explore datasets, run statistical analyses, and present insights through clear visualizations and reports.

Outside of university, I enjoy experimenting with datasets from Kaggle and creating small projects that combine economic reasoning with data analytics. I’m eager to continue growing in this field and contribute to data-driven environments with curiosity, precision, and a problem-solving mindset.

This repository is where I share my learning progress, publish exploratory projects, and showcase my skills in data analysis, business intelligence, and applied economics.
