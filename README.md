****About****

Hi, I'm Said! I'm currently pursuing a Master’s degree in *Applied Economics and Markets* at the University of Bologna, where I’m building a strong foundation in quantitative analysis, data interpretation, and economic modeling.

I’m passionate about using data to understand complex systems and support decision-making. During my academic journey, I've worked with tools like **Python, R, SQL, Excel, and Power BI** to explore datasets, run statistical analyses, and present insights through clear visualizations and reports.

Outside of university, I enjoy experimenting with datasets from Kaggle and creating small projects that combine economic reasoning with data analytics. I’m eager to continue growing in this field and contribute to data-driven environments with curiosity, precision, and a problem-solving mindset.

This repository is where I share my learning progress, publish exploratory projects, and showcase my skills in **data analysis, business intelligence, and applied economics**.
